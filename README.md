## Project Description

We are creating a platform for digital marketers to be able to browse work done by other content creators, or view the work done by various agencies.

Clients, or potential clients, are also able to browse our plateform to look for good candidates to onboard for their current marketing campaigns.

Content creators, or digital marketers, will be able to browse our plateform to draw inspiration from other digital marketers/agenices, and also collaborate with them.

This plateform will resemble the likes of Behance, with pretty much identical functionality, just heavily focused on the digital marketers rather than the designer.

We are looking to cultivate a family of marketers, individuals passionate about marketing and marketing firms.

The end goal is to be able to be the #1 plateform of connection, inspiration and collaboration for digital marketers and potential clients.
